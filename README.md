# Probability Distributions
Python project to make plots of various probability distributions and sample and save random numbers from these distributions

## TODO:
- Include more probability distributions
- Rewrite display function so it works without saving a .png-file every time (see [sorting_visualization](https://github.com/DschiPeunt/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/sorting_visualization.py) for code ideas)
